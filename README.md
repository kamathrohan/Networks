# Networks
This piece of code is written to simulate networks and grow them, without the use of external librarys (networkx has only been used for visualisations), as a part of the coursework required for Complexity and Networks at Imperial College London. 


The network models grown are:

1. Barabási–Albert (BA) model
2. Random Model 
3. Mixed Model (a combination of both BA and Random)
